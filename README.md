### Course Abstract

In this course, we learn how to analyze and forecast time series, study the basic theoretical concepts without going too deep into mathematical aspects, examine different models and techniques. Along the way, we make our hands dirty applying all studied models to a real-world dataset of UK foreign visits using such trendy Python libraries as StatsModels, Prophet, scikit-learn, and keras.

You will see, there is nothing complex in understanding and forecasting time series, you just need the right tools and the knowledge.
